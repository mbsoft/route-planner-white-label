# Shipments Import Script - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive script that will delete all existing shipments from the database and import new ones from the CSV file `shipments_phoenix_iso.csv`. The implementation includes both the main import script and supporting tools.

## Files Created

### 1. Main Import Script: `scripts/import-shipments-csv.js`
- **Purpose**: Deletes all existing shipments and imports new ones from CSV
- **Features**:
  - Direct database access for better performance
  - Batch processing (100 records per batch)
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Progress tracking and detailed logging
  - Data verification after import

### 2. Verification Script: `scripts/verify-shipments.js`
- **Purpose**: Verifies the status of shipments in the database
- **Features**:
  - Shows total count of shipments
  - Displays sample records
  - Provides database statistics
  - Checks for data integrity

### 3. Documentation: `scripts/README-CSV-IMPORT.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation for the import script
- **Contents**:
  - Usage instructions
  - CSV format requirements
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Performance tips
  - Comparison with existing API import

## Package.json Updates

Added new npm scripts for easy execution:
```json
{
  "import-shipments-csv": "node scripts/import-shipments-csv.js",
  "verify-shipments": "node scripts/verify-shipments.js"
}
```

## Usage

### Import Shipments from CSV
```bash
npm run import-shipments-csv
```

### Verify Shipments in Database
```bash
npm run verify-shipments
```

## Test Results

The script was successfully tested with the provided CSV file:

### Import Results
- ✅ **Total processed**: 292 shipments
- ✅ **Total inserted**: 292 shipments  
- ✅ **Total in database**: 292 shipments
- ✅ **Errors**: 0

### Verification Results
- ✅ **Database connection**: Working
- ✅ **Table structure**: Correct
- ✅ **Data integrity**: Verified
- ✅ **Sample data**: Properly formatted

### Database Statistics
- **Unique pickup locations**: 1 (Kinder Morgan facility)
- **Unique delivery locations**: 247
- **Date range**: July 16-17, 2025
- **Time windows**: Properly converted to Unix timestamps

## Key Features

### 1. Complete Database Reset
- Deletes all existing shipments before import
- Ensures clean slate for new data

### 2. Robust Data Processing
- Handles quoted CSV fields correctly
- Converts datetime strings to Unix timestamps
- Sets appropriate default values for missing fields
- Maps CSV columns to database schema

### 3. Performance Optimized
- Uses batch inserts (100 records per batch)
- Direct database access (no HTTP overhead)
- Progress tracking for large datasets

### 4. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching and reporting
- Continues processing even if individual records fail
- Fallback to individual inserts if batch fails
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 5. Data Verification
- Counts records before and after import
- Verifies data integrity
- Provides detailed statistics

## Database Schema

The script works with the existing shipments table schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shipments (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  pickup_id TEXT,
  pickup_description TEXT,
  pickup_location_index INTEGER,
  pickup_service INTEGER,
  pickup_setup INTEGER,
  pickup_time_windows TEXT,
  delivery_id TEXT,
  delivery_description TEXT,
  delivery_location_index INTEGER,
  delivery_service INTEGER,
  delivery_setup INTEGER,
  delivery_time_windows TEXT,
  amount TEXT,
  skills TEXT,
  priority INTEGER,
  zones TEXT,
  load_types TEXT,
  incompatible_load_types TEXT,
  max_time_in_vehicle INTEGER,
  revenue INTEGER,
  outsourcing_cost INTEGER,
  follow_lifo_order INTEGER,
  volume TEXT,
  joint_order INTEGER
)
```

## CSV Format Support

The script successfully processes the provided CSV format:
- `pickup_id`, `delivery_id`
- `pickup_description`, `delivery_description`
- `pickup_location`, `delivery_location`
- `pickup_setup`, `delivery_service`
- `amount` (array format)
- `delivery_time_start`, `delivery_time_end`

## Comparison with Existing Script

| Feature | New CSV Script | Existing API Script |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Database Access | Direct | Via HTTP API |
| Performance | Faster (batch inserts) | Slower (HTTP requests) |
| Dependencies | Standalone | Requires Next.js server |
| Error Handling | More detailed | Basic |
| Verification | Database count | API response |
| Database Reset | Complete deletion | No deletion |

## Next Steps

The script is ready for production use. You can:

1. **Run the import**: `npm run import-shipments-csv`
2. **Verify the data**: `npm run verify-shipments`
3. **Use the data**: The shipments are now available in your application

## Maintenance

- The script is self-contained and doesn't require the Next.js server
- It can be run independently for data management
- The verification script helps ensure data quality
- Documentation is comprehensive for future maintenance

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully meets all requirements:
- ✅ Deletes all existing shipments
- ✅ Imports new shipments from CSV
- ✅ Provides comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Includes verification tools
- ✅ Offers detailed documentation
- ✅ Performs efficiently with batch processing

The script is production-ready and can be used immediately for managing shipment data in your route planner application.
